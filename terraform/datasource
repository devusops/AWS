Datasources
• For certain providers (like AWS), terraform provides datasources
• Datasources provide you with dynamic information
• A lot of data is available by AWS in a structured format using their API
• Terraform also exposes this information using data sources
• Examples:
• List of AMIs
• List of availability Zones
