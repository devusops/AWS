 In ec2 instance to check  the available disks using the following command.
lsblk


Check if the volume has any data using the following command.

sudo file -s /dev/xvdf

If the above command output shows “/dev/xvdf: data“, it means your volume is empty.

Format the volume to the ext4 filesystem using the following command.

sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

Alternatively, you can also use the xfs format. You have to use either ext4 or xfs.

sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf

sudo mkdir /newvolume

Mount the volume to “newvolume” directory using the following command.

sudo mount /dev/xvdf /newvolume/

cd into newvolume directory and check the disk space to validate the volume mount.

cd /newvolume

df -h .

The above command should show the free space in the newvolume directory.

To unmount the volume, use the unmount command as shown below..

umount /dev/xvdf
